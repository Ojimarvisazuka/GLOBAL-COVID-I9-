## Introduction
This project was mandated by Quantum Analytics NG as part of my internship. The instruction was to carry out a live analysis of COVID-19 dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO) website for an up-to-date COVID-19 events. 


## Problem Statement
The idea behind this project was to get an up-to-date rundown of active and live events regarding Covid-19. Others include:

- Find out what the trend has been like overtime
- Know the worst hit Nations and how they fared
- To know which time of the year records the highest virus spread
- Develop a containment model or plan to cope with the virus going forward.


## Data Sourcing
To access the data needed for this project,  I summarily went to the WHO website which you can find [here](https://covid19.who.int/).
I imported the web link to my Power BI desktop web-link page; selected the relevant tables to the project and loaded it to the Power Query Editor for transformation and cleaning in order to ensure data quality
